# Sisyphus

A game for the Dublin 1 Game a Month's August theme of "Give Up". The inspiration is from Camus' _The Myth of Sisyphus_

>  I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

I wanted to see if this would extend to a game of Sisyphus too. Would it be possible for a player to constantly push a boulder up a hill only to start again and again and still be happy?

This represents my second attempt at this. The first was written using LÃ–VE's Box2d-based physics. It was entirely the wrong tool for the job, but provided some interesting-slash-hilarious results.
